# Merge Sort

1. For the merge sort method we are going to use the following array;
![Input Array](img/one.png)

1. We start by splitting the entire array in half(or as close to it as we can)
![Input Array](img/two.png)

1. Now we are going to select the left side of the subarray.
![Input Array](img/three.png)

1. Repeat the same method as before by splitting the array into two again.
![Input Array](img/four.png)

1. Select the left side of this subarray
![Input Array](img/five.png)
1. Split this array in half
![Input Array](img/six.png)
1. Now, we can compare the two values in the two different arrays. 
![Input Array](img/seven.png)
1. If the left side is less than the right side, push the value into the placeholder for the left side of the old array. 
![Input Array](img/eight.png)
1. Return the temporary numbers in the array.
![Input Array](img/nine.png)
1. Now that the left side is done, move onto the right side of the array. 
![Input Array](img/ten.png)
1. Split the left side of the array 
![Input Array](img/eleven.png)
1. Evaluate the values in the right side of the array. 
![Input Array](img/twelve.png)
1. Push the lower value into the array, followed by the second. 
![Input Array](img/thirteen.png)
1. Now, compare the left values and the right values and push the values into the original array.
![Input Array](img/fourteen.png)
1. Push the lower values into the arrays 
![Input Array](img/fifteen.png)
1. Return the original array, and the we are sorted. 
![Input Array](img/sixteen.png)

> That was easy enough!!
